# **Pokemon - Client Side**
This part of the project is the client side where the user can see and interact with the app.

## **Description**
For this last project I decided to do something related with Pokemon where a user can create thier own pokemon by filling out the name, the type of the Pokemon, the attack it has and its weakness. The user can also update thier pokemon as well as delete too. They can also view all the Pokemon they created as well. A user can only create a Pokemon, update it, view it if they are signed in. The user should be able to sign-up successfully, sign-in successfully, change thier password successfully and sign out as well.
